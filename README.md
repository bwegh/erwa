Erwa
====
[![passing or failing?](https://travis-ci.org/bwegh/erwa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bwegh/erwa/)


Erwa is an implementation of [WAMP (Web Application Messaging Protocol)](http://wamp.ws/spec/) router in Erlang.
The client/peer side has been moved to a seperate project called [Awre](https://github.com/bwegh/awre). Both use the library [Wamper](https://github.com/bwegh/wamper).

Router
======
The router implementation in Erwa uses the great [ranch](https://github.com/ninenines/ranch)
and [cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) from [Lo√Øc Hoguin (essen)](https://github.com/essen)
to handle the incomming connections and the webserver part for the websockets.
Erwa has two modules to work either as a protocol for ranch on incomming TCP connections, or
as websocket handler with cowboy on incomming websocket connections.

All you need to do to get a simple WAMP router up and running is to add a dispatch rule to
ranch and/or cowboy:

A WAMP router on websockets:
```Erlang
%% start erwa to handle any incomming connections to any host at the path /wamp
%% start it with 100 parallel acceptors on port 8080
ok = erwa:start_websocket("/wamp", 8080, 100).
```
In the examples directory you can find the simple_router which includes just the above
and starts a WAMP router, including a simple javascript client,
using [wampy.js](https://github.com/KSDaemon/wampy.js).

The other possibility is to start Erwa as a TCP router:
```Erlang
%% start erwa listening for raw tcp connections on port 5555
%% starting it with 5 parallel acceptors
ok = erwa:start_socket(5555,5).
```
This is also included in the simple_router example in the examples directory.

By default Erwa does not automatically create realms. This is activated by the boolean
*autocreate_realm* flag.
If you only want to support certain realm you need to start them by using erwa:start_realm/1,
which takes the name of the realm to start as argument.

Examples
========

In the exampes directory you can find a simple router example:
 * simple_router: A very tiny example, showing how easy it is to fire up a WAMP router using Erwa.
